Microsoft Paint is a fan favourite and so I decided why not create a custom version of it using Python.
The program is very simple and doesn't have much functionality, it includes a simple drawing feature,
with the ability to change the colour and brush size, there are a few different preset colours and it
also has the ability to create your own custom colours.

As stated it is pretty bare and doesn't have many features. I might come back to the project
and maybe add some more fuctions such as a saving feature.

Modules required:
  
  * Tkinter

How to use:

Run draw.py and start drawing!
